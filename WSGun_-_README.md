# WSGun_Game
it is a game same as rock paper scissors
in this game we have two users one of them would be our computer and it will pick a
random number according to itself only as i have used *random function* here.after that when it has chosen its number we actually chose that what number denotes what *letter*
and as we all know how the game works i want you to copy this code and go to your python console and run it 
when you will run it will show that comp already has chosen its number now its your turn to pick your letter "let me tell you"
s-snake,w-water and g goes for gun and yes ! it is not a normal game in this you will chose some letter other then
s,w,g then it wont work it will exit and say that.... WHY DONT YOU TRY IT YOURSELF
Thankyou,hope you have liked my first ever game.
